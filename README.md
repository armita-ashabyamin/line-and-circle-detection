# line-and-circle-detection
This project shows how to detect lines and circles in binary images using morphological operations in OpenCV. It uses custom-designed kernels for shape detection,applies erosion,dilation,opening,and closing techniques,visualizes results using Matplotlib. it includes a method for counting detected components using connected component analysis.
